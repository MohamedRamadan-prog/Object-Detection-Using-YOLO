- YOLO is an object detection pipeline based on Neural Network. Contrast to prior work on object detection with classifiers to perform detection, YOLO frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance

# steps to use the YOLO for detection:
I) Resizing the input image to 448x448
II) Running a single convolutional network on the image
III) Thresholding the resulting detections by the modelâ€™s confidence
